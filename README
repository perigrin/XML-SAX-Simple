XML/SAX/Simple
==============

This is a SAX version of XML::Simple. It works exactly the same
as XML::Simple, so see the documentation of that module for details.
The benefit of using this over XML::Simple is that XML::SAX::Simple
will use any Perl SAX2 parser installed on your system (via XML::SAX),
rather than being hard coded to use XML::Parser.
